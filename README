This directory contains brief explaination about this Web XSS challenge (The Enchanted Mirror).

The Enchanted Mirror is a medium-level web security challenge designed to demonstrate a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. 
The application reflects user input directly onto the page without proper sanitization, allowing injected JavaScript to execute in the browser.
Participants must identify the vulnerability, trigger script execution, and inspect the dynamically modified DOM to retrieve the real flag. 
A decoy flag is intentionally placed in the page source to prevent trivial solutions and encourage runtime analysis.
This project was developed for educational purposes to help students understand client-side web vulnerabilities and the importance of secure input handling.

Note: 🪞 The mirror repeats everything it hears, but its secrets appear only after a spell is cast.
